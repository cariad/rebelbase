# Contributing to RebelBase

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ If you're reading this then I assume you have a bug, feature request or code change to contribute. Thank you!

This guide will help you get your change into the project as quickly and smoothly as possible.

## Bugs

Please report bugs at [github.com/cariad/rebelbase/issues](https://github.com/cariad/rebelbase/issues) and include:

- Your Python version
- A code sample that reproduces the problem
- The _exact_ error message or miscalculation that you encountered

If you'd like to fix the bug yourself then mention that in the report and we'll discuss your approach. **I won't accept any pull requests that we didn't discuss first.**

## Feature requests

Please raise feature requests at [github.com/cariad/rebelbase/issues](https://github.com/cariad/rebelbase/issues) and include a compelling justification for the change.

If you'd like to code the feature yourself then mention that in the report and we'll discuss your approach. **I won't accept any pull requests that we didn't discuss first.**
